1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?React by Tong Zhou was well delivered. She has knowledge in details and delivered what she learned pretty well. The length and pace of her talk was well structured. The Q&A was also well answered 2. Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn? I learned the most from Haoyuan’s Apache vs Nginx talk. We have been building web applications but we did not mention much about the server. The difference between Apache and Nginx was well delivered and suggested what to use if we are to build another online application3. Which talk did you like the best and why?I like Sishan’s Online Ads vs AdBlock the most since it broke down the online advertising detail and even the price bid of searching ads. It is very crucial for frontend engineers since the most profit made from frontend is commercials. He delivered the content in a great pace and logical flow and is why I like it best.
