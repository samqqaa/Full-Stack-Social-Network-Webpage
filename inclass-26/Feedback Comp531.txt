What did you hope to learn but did not? More about detail in web application instead of history of deprecated modules. How modern web application interact and some basic detail about web.¥ What did you really enjoy learning about? React and redux are very useful and powerful. This part is especially hard to implement and I wish the pace of the class was a little slower that everyone can catch up on the concept and workflow instead of spending dozens of hours trying to figure it out online.¥ What worked well in the course? and how?The inclass exercises built up to be hws and the class has coherency. ¥ What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved? Too much information in such short period of time. I feel like you can go over few things in detail rather than throwing lots of info to us.¥ What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of in class exercises, goals of projects Ð and be specific please! ¥ Anything else you like to say?For half of the inclass exercises, it would save us lots of time if you just go through the register/function with us in class. It should take less than 5 minutes but mostly took us more than 1.5 hrs.Overall a very good course! It would be great if the final grade is friendly to us.
